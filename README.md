# HCP
## Feature Diversity or Feature Interactions: Which Drive Effective Configuration Testing Prioritization for Highly Configurable Software?

### Overview
HCP is a tool designed for internal feature-interaction analysis and configuration prioritization in highly configurable software systems. It performs variability-aware static analysis to extract internal feature interactions and leverages them to guide configuration-level testing prioritization.

### How to Run HCP

## Subject Systems
In our study, we evaluate HCP using real faults collected by Medeiros et al. ([FCM](https://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~spg/sampling/)) and the Variability Bugs Database ([VBDb](https://vbdb.bitbucket.io/)).

## Download and Install Joern
In our work, we rely on [Jess](https://tuanngokien.github.io/splc2021/), an extension of Joern, to parse variability-aware code property graphs (vaCPGs).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LPhD/Jess.git
```
